additional-paste-settings-options-requester-multiplier-type=Let's you choose between considering by: how much the Item Stacks; based on how much the Recipe Consumes of each item type; or the Time Spent on crafting the item.
additional-paste-settings-options-requester-multiplier-value=Defines how much will be requested for logistic chests, depending on the Multiplier Type that was chosen. If Time was chosen, then this will be in seconds spent on crafting.
additional-paste-settings-options-inserter-multiplier-type=Let's you choose between considering by: how much the Item Stacks; based on how much the Recipe Consumes of each item type; or the Time Spent on crafting the item.
